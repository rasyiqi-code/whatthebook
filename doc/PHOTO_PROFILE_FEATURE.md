# Photo Profile Feature Implementation

## Overview
The photo profile feature allows users to upload and manage their profile pictures. Users can take photos with their camera, select images from their gallery, or enter image URLs manually.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Image Picking
- **Camera**: Take photos directly with device camera
- **Gallery**: Select existing images from device gallery
- **URL Input**: Manually enter image URLs

### 2. Image Upload
- **Supabase Storage**: Images are uploaded to the `book-covers` bucket in a `profiles` subfolder
- **File Validation**: Validates file size (max 5MB) and supported formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- **Image Optimization**: Automatically resizes images to 400x400 pixels with 85% quality

### 3. User Experience
- **Loading States**: Shows loading indicator during upload
- **Error Handling**: Displays user-friendly error messages
- **Success Feedback**: Shows success message when upload completes
- **Real-time Updates**: Profile picture updates immediately after upload

## Technical Implementation

### 1. ProfileImageService
Location: `lib/core/services/profile_image_service.dart`

**Key Methods:**
- `pickImageFromGallery()`: Opens gallery picker
- `takePhotoWithCamera()`: Opens camera
- `uploadProfileImage(XFile image, String userId)`: Uploads image to Supabase
- `validateImage(XFile image)`: Validates file size and format
- `deleteProfileImage(String imageUrl)`: Deletes image from storage

### 2. EditProfilePage Updates
Location: `lib/features/auth/presentation/pages/edit_profile_page.dart`

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced simulated image picker with real image picking
- Added loading states for image upload
- Integrated with ProfileImageService
- Added proper error handling and user feedback

### 3. Dependency Injection
Location: `lib/core/injection/injection_container.dart`

**Added:**
- `ProfileImageService` registration as lazy singleton

## Storage Structure

```
book-covers/
├── profiles/
│   ├── profile_[user-id]_[timestamp].jpg
│   ├── profile_[user-id]_[timestamp].png
│   └── ...
└── [other book cover files]
```

## File Naming Convention
- Format: `profile_[user-id]_[timestamp].[extension]`
- Example: `profile_abc123_1703123456789.jpg`

## Supported File Types
- **JPG/JPEG**: Most common format
- **PNG**: Good for images with transparency
- **GIF**: Animated images (static display)
- **WebP**: Modern format with good compression

## File Size Limits
- **Maximum Size**: 5MB per image
- **Recommended Size**: Under 2MB for faster uploads
- **Automatic Resizing**: Images are resized to 400x400 pixels

## Error Handling

### Common Errors:
1. **File Too Large**: "Invalid image. Please select a valid image file under 5MB."
2. **Unsupported Format**: "Invalid image. Please select a valid image file (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)."
3. **Upload Failed**: "Failed to upload image: [error message]"
4. **Network Issues**: "Failed to upload image: Network error"

### Validation Rules:
- File size ≤ 5MB
- File extension in allowed list
- Valid image format
- User authentication required

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. Navigate to Edit Profile page
2. Tap the camera icon on profile picture
3. Choose source: Camera, Gallery, or URL
4. Select/take photo or enter URL
5. Wait for upload to complete
6. Save profile changes

### For Developers:
1. The feature is automatically available in EditProfilePage
2. No additional setup required
3. Images are automatically saved to user's profile
4. Old images are not automatically deleted (manual cleanup needed)

## Security Considerations

### Storage Policies:
- Images are stored in public bucket for easy access
- User authentication required for upload
- File size and type validation on client and server
- Unique filenames prevent conflicts

### Privacy:
- Profile images are publicly accessible
- Consider implementing private storage for sensitive images
- User can delete their own images

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:
1. **Image Cropping**: Allow users to crop images before upload
2. **Multiple Formats**: Support more image formats
3. **Image Compression**: Better compression algorithms
4. **CDN Integration**: Faster image delivery
5. **Image Backup**: Automatic backup of profile images

### Technical Improvements:
1. **Caching**: Local caching of profile images
2. **Progressive Loading**: Show low-res images first
3. **Batch Operations**: Handle multiple image uploads
4. **Image Processing**: Server-side image optimization

## Testing

### Manual Testing:
1. Test camera functionality on device
2. Test gallery picker on device
3. Test URL input with valid/invalid URLs
4. Test file size limits
5. Test unsupported file formats
6. Test network error scenarios

### Automated Testing:
- Unit tests for ProfileImageService
- Widget tests for EditProfilePage
- Integration tests for upload flow

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Permission Denied**: Check camera/gallery permissions
2. **Upload Fails**: Check network connection and Supabase configuration
3. **Image Not Loading**: Check image URL validity
4. **Large File Error**: Compress image before upload

### Debug Steps:
1. Check console logs for error messages
2. Verify Supabase storage bucket exists
3. Test with smaller image files
4. Check network connectivity

## Dependencies

### Required Packages:
- `image_picker: ^1.1.2` - For image picking
- `supabase_flutter: ^2.9.1` - For storage operations

### Platform Permissions:
- **Android**: Camera and storage permissions
- **iOS**: Camera and photo library permissions
- **Web**: File input permissions

## Configuration

### Supabase Setup:
1. Ensure `book-covers` bucket exists
2. Verify storage policies allow authenticated uploads
3. Check file size limits in bucket settings

### App Permissions:
- Add camera permission to Android manifest
- Add photo library permission to iOS info.plist
- Configure web permissions for file uploads
